# Hypersonic-Flows-Notes-AE720-
This is a repo for the notes of a course called hypersonics, and these are made to be able to practice skills for web development. The notes are completely made in HTML for now, and will plan to add CSS and JS in future. This repository is made when the mid semester exams for this exam has just ended.
