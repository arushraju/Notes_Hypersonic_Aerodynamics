                    Hypersonic flow equations are non linear in nature, and this could be seen from the vorticity interaction, and thin shock layer. But recall that the pertubation velocity potential equation, is 
                    linear when applied to thin body for small angle of attack (for subsonic and supersonic), whereas for transonic and hypersonic, it would have resulted in non-linear equation.
                    For supersonic flows, the expression given above could be used to calculate the coefficient of pressure. And we see that it only depends on theta, and mach number.

                    <p>What is the perturbation velocity potential equation?</p>
                    <p>
                        The perturbation velocity potential equation is derived under the assumption of compressible, irrotational, isentropic flow. In such flows, the velocity field can be expressed using a potential function 𝜙, where the velocity components are simply the spatial derivatives of 
                        ϕ. By substituting this potential representation into the governing equations of fluid motion and then considering the case of small disturbances to a uniform freestream, we arrive at a governing equation for the perturbation potential, usually denoted by 
                        ϕ′.This equation forms the basis of thin-airfoil theory and linearized supersonic theory.

                    <p>
                        Why is it that the perturbation velocity potential equation is linear when applied to thin bodies at small angle of attack for subsonic and supersonic flows, but becomes non-linear in the cases of transonic and hypersonic flows?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    The perturbation velocity potential equation starts from the assumption of irrotational, compressible, isentropic flow, where the velocity field can be described using a potential function. For thin bodies at small angle of attack, the disturbances introduced into the freestream are very small compared to the freestream velocity. In subsonic and supersonic flows, these perturbations remain small enough that we can linearize the governing equation by neglecting higher-order terms. The result is a linear partial differential equation, which is why theories like thin-airfoil theory for subsonic flows or linearized supersonic theory work so well. However, this simplification breaks down in two regimes. In transonic flows, even a small disturbance can cause local regions where the flow speed crosses Mach 1. This generates large variations in pressure and velocity, so the higher-order terms that were previously neglected suddenly become significant. This makes the governing potential equation non-linear in character. Similarly, in hypersonic flows, the disturbances are no longer small because of extreme compressibility effects, thin shock layers, and strong shock–boundary layer interactions. These effects reintroduce the non-linear terms into the potential equation, just as in the transonic case, but for different physical reasons. This is why the perturbation velocity potential equation is linear only for subsonic and supersonic flows under small disturbance assumptions, but becomes non-linear for both transonic and hypersonic regimes.

                    This is also called <b> Newton's sine square law</b>. And this theory had very low accurcy for low speed flow, but quite high accuracy for high speed flows.

                <p>The following video is useful for learning about Newton's Sin Law: <a href="https://youtu.be/yCDEWE0CijY?si=-gYA36VCGBI4PWUY">Link</a></p>
                <p>
                    Consider a uniform flow feild that is incindednt on flat plate at an angle theta. And when this happens the flow looses all its normal component of momentum which is seen out in the form of force that is normal to plate. And the tangential component of the flow is preserved.
                    So we see that the theory infact comes from concervation of momentum.
                    Following is the proof:

        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                    The rate of change of momentum is equal to force, and thus the obtained expression for rate of chnage of momentum could be equated to force generated normal to the plate.
                    Now different component of this resultant force will give us lift and drag.
                    Dividing the the expression by area will result in expression for pressure.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    It is important to note that this pressure obtained is purely due to rectilinear motion of particles of flow (as that is the assumption of newton's laws). But we know that pressure due to gas is purely due to random motion of particle.
                    In fluid mechanics, we always measure the change in pressure relative to the free stream in far stream is unaffected. And on the surface the molecules are deflected, thus momentum is changed. So the impact pressure corrsponding to the diffrence between what the plate is expereinces and what it would have experienced if only the free stream staic pressure acted. And this is delta_p.
                </p>

        Now lets see how does this law has relation to hypersonic flows.

                    Consider a hypersonic flow over wedge as shown in the figure. We know that the shock layer will be thin.
                    When view the image from far, we see that the flow just hits the plate and then starts flowing in the direction of the wedge. 
                    And this is very similar to the newton flow that we saw earlier. And this is possible only because the shock layer is thin in case of hypersonic flow.
                </p>
                <p>It should be noted that this is an approximate method.</p>

                    So at some point we first find it's tangnet, and once the tangnet is known we could find the angle it makes with the incoming velocity vector, 
                    and this theta could be used to calcuate coefficien of pressure in hypersonic flow, at that point.

                    And therefore the coefficient of pressure at the rear portion of the body is taken to be equal to zero in newtonian flow.

                    We apply the newtonian model on a flat plate at inclination \(\alpha\) and chord length \(c\). And we have already seen that the pressure acting on the flat plate will be acting normal to the flat plate.
                    Now to calculate the total pressure acting on the plate noraml to it, we would intergate the coefficiemt of pressure over the flat plate. The \(c_{p}\) value will be 
                    depend only on the local inclination which is constant through out the plate, and thus the intergation will yeild as shown above.

                    The figure to the right represent variations of \(L/D\), \(C_{L}\) and \(C_{D}\) with angle of attack. It appears that
                    \(alpha\) = 0, the value of \(l/d\) approaches zero. And this happens becuase the fluid we are considering is invicid. and once friction is aded, at that \(alpah\) the \(L/D\) will approch to zero.
                    Looking at the  \(C_l\), the maximum \(C_l\) occurs at somewhere ner 45 degrees, and this is also what is almost observed in real. And from 0 to 15 degree, thje curve is non linear, whcih is different 
                    from subsonic and supersonic flow, where we said that \(C_l\) and \(C_d\) varies linearly for small angle of attacks.

                    This modified Newtonian Sin Square Law was proposed by <b>Lesteer Lees</b>.
                    It first uses \(C_p_max\) instead of 2, and then \(C_p_max\) is defined as coefficient of pressure at the point where 
                    the shock wave is normal shock. So here we will get the maximum change in stagnation pressure. And then we could use the <b>Rayleigh Pitot Tube Eqaution</b> to gett he relation between stagnation pressure inside the normal shock and free stream pressure outside the normal shock.

                    Once \(p_{0_{2}}/p_{\infty}\) is known we could substitue it inside the expression of \(c_{p_{max}}\). 
                    It could be seen that as M approaches \(\infty\), the value of \(c_{p_{max}}\) approaches constant, and the constant will depend on gas.
                    And another thing is that this \(C_{p_{max}M=\infty}\) will increases and approach to two when \(\gamma\) value approaches to one.

                    Let us consider the \(C_p\) relation with Mach Number in the expression given above for oblique shock. If we consider the mach number apporaching infinity, and gamma appraching 1, we get the simplified expression \(c_p=2\sin(\beta)^2\). It is important to not that \(\beta\) here is shock wave angle and not deflection angle.

            <li>
                <p>
                    Similarly taking relation between density ratio and mach number,m and beta, we see that as mach number appraches infinity, and gamma approches 1 the expression reduces to \(\frac{\rho_2}{\rho_{\infty}} = \infty\)

                    Now uisng the first an dthird poitn we could say that \(C_{p} = 2\sin(\theta)\). And this is same as the newtonian flow result. And this measn that if the density ratio tends to infinity, the shock wave is parallel to the body, meaning it gets sticked to body surface. And at that point the flow will start behaving like newtonain flow.
