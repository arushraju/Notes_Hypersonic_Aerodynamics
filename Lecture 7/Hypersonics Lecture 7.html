    <p>
        The concept of flow similarity is well known in fluid mechnaics. Two flows are said to be dynamically similar, if the similarity parameter are same in both the flow.

                    Consider the hypersonic flow over the slender body. TO solve the equation we will need to have preoper boundary cndition insde the shock layer.
                    Thses are the eqaution that were derived previously.

                    We are considering invicid flow, so only tangetial velocity at the boundary. The direction cosine is also transformed.
