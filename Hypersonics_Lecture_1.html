            I already know that there are some drastic changes that occur in the flow once the Mach number reaches 1. This makes sense to me because, at that point, the speed of the object becomes equal to the speed at which disturbances (sound waves) propagate through the medium. That’s why the transition from subsonic to supersonic is so special: information about the motion of the object can no longer travel upstream, shock waves form, and the entire flow behavior changes fundamentally.
            But what I am wondering is: what exactly is so special about Mach number equal to 5? After all, the flow is still supersonic just like at Mach 2 or Mach 3. So, apart from simply being “faster,” what physical changes occur at Mach 5 that make it deserving of a separate classification (hypersonic)? Is there really something fundamentally different that happens around Mach 5, or is this division just an artificial boundary that people use?

            You’re right: the biggest visible/special change happens near Mach 1, because of the sudden appearance of shock waves, choking, and the change from subsonic to supersonic flow. After that, it feels like the flow should just “stay supersonic” and scale up smoothly.
            But there is another threshold where things start to feel qualitatively different: around Mach 5, which is why we label it as the start of hypersonic flow. 
            And whtas makes it special are it's characteristics.
            Here’s what makes it special compared to just supersonic (Characteristics of hypersonic flows):

                    <h3><b>Thin Shock Layer</b></h3>
                    <img src="./Slide4.jpg" alt="Thin Shock Layer Slide" height="500px"/>
                    <p>
                        As the mach number increaes the density of the flow acorss the shock waves increaes,and since the mass folow rate is proportional to product of aera and density, a given mass floow rate can sweeze through a smaller area.
                        In flow over a wedge, with increase in mach number as siad the density will keep on increasing and this will increase the density, and this will decrease the area of flow. Which means that the shock layer will tilt towards the body surface. And this results in <b>Thin Shock Layer</b>. The implication of that are as follows:
                        Using oblique shock relation using theta-beat-mach number relation we get at M=36, and wedge angle (deflection angle) = 15 degrees, the shock angle comes out to be equal to 18 degrees. And this shows that the shock layer (which is the region between body surface and shock) is very small. The first complication is that this shock may interact wihtt he growing boundary layer, and this will make it difficult to predict analytically thigns, happening on the surface.
                        There are many more complications.

                    <h3><b>Viscous Interactions</b></h3>
                    <img class="image image5" src="./Slide5.jpg" alt="Slide for viscous interaction" height="500px"/>
                    <p>
                        Consider flow over flat plate, where due to flow, the boundary layer will get growing on it. Inside the boundary layer the large kinetic energy associated to the shock layer gtes converted into thermal energy (Viscous dissipation). As a result,of which the boundary layer temperatuire increaes normal to boundary layer. 
                        This temperature increaes will chnage the viscosity (viscocity increases and this means the bounday layer becomes thicker).
                        The second thing that happen, is that pressure remains constant normal to boundarylayer, and if temperature increases across the boundary layer, the density will have to decreaes from the state equation of gas. And as the density decreaes normal to the boundary layer, the area of flow for a given mass flow rate will have to increase, and this will further increase the boundary layer thickness.
                        So <b>Viscocity</b> and <b>Density</b> will make the boundary layer grow it's thockness rapidly in the case of hypersonic flows.
                        For laminar compressible flat plate boundary layer, the thickness is more influenced by the mach number thna the reynoild's number.
                        When the boundarylayer layer is thick it is going to displcae the outer invicid flow, and then this displavced poutflow, will again chnage the flow state in the boundary layer. And this is called <b>Viscous Interactions</b>. And this will significatly effe ct pressure distribution, and thus lift and drag.
                        At extreme, the boundarylayer becomes so thick that it may combine with the Shock Wavce over it. And in such a case, it becomes difficult to solve th problem analytically. And in such case the entire shock layer has to be considered viscous.

                                We have discussied about viscous dissipation, and as siad, this could cause hoight tempearture regions inside the boundary layer. This temperature can reach too high, even to a point where it could cause significant dissociation and ionisation of gas molecules within the bondary layer.
                                And boundary layer that containes different species of gaes that are recating is called <b>>Chemically recating boundary layer</b>. This boundary layer could also ract with the chemical that makes up the body surface. And this will make the boundary layer very reactive.

                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                In case of hypersonic flow, the entire shock layer could be recative. Example, if we have a blunt body, and a detached shock in from of it. And the distance between shock and the body surface tip is called <b>Shock Stand off Distance</b>. And the fluid between shock layer and body is called shock layer. For a very large mach number flow, the entire shock layer could be very chemically reactive.
                                This could lead to <b>Equillibrium</b> or <b>Non-Equillibrium</b> flow around the vehicle. What does it mean?

                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                Another effect of high temperature flow is the Aerodynamics heating. Due to high temperatruie in the shocjk layer, there would be significant amount of heta getting convected to the surface of the aircraft. And at eevn high temperature, the shock layer could also transfer heat to surface via radiation.

                            <p>
                                And if the temperatuere at the periphery of the surface is very large, due to ionosation of agse, we have free electron present in the outer edges of object.A nd this will hinder the radio communication, leading to <b>Black out in communication</b>. its beacuse this radio frequecy waves will be absorbed by the electorns.
                                This is very common during re-entry of space vehicles.

                                All the above mentioned factor will significantly effect the lift and drag charcateristics on the aircraft. And this what makes hypersonic flows different from other flow regimes.

                                Consider a blund body, we know that the shock layer will be dettached from the body, in this case. Due to smooth curve. And also in case of hypersonic flow the shock dettachment distnce will be lower then that of supersonic flows.
                                As the gas moves across the shock waves, the <b>Entropy</b> of gas increases, and this increase in entropy also increases with strenght of the shock wave.

                                If we consider the centerline, that encounters the normal shock at the nose for the object, it will have maximum change in entorpy. But as the streamlines move away from the centerline, the change in entropy that they encounter, will decrease.
                                And this means we will have a gradient of entropy present behind the shock wave. And thats called entrpoy layer. The boundary layer grows inside the entrpoy layer

                                We know using <b>Crocco's Theorem</b>, the Entropy layer is the region of strong Vorticity. And interaction between Boundnary Layer and Entropy Layer is called <b>Vorticity interaction</b>.

        <ul>
            <li>
                Hypersonic flow is not just about high mach number, but also about kinetic energy which is high enough to dissocikate or ionize gas molecules.
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Why M=5?</b></p>
                <p>
                    it is at this Mach number where all the discussed chracteristics appear. That is why we conventionally define hypersonic flow at M=5. These flows are typicallty encounter in <b>Re-Entry vehicles</b>,<b>Scramjet Engines</b><b>Ballistic Missiles</b>.
                    And this flow is also encountered by the astroids which is also why they just get burnt in the atmosphere.
